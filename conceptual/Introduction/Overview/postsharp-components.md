# PostSharp Components


## PostSharp Tools for Visual Studio

This is the user interface of PostSharp. It extends the Visual Studio editor and provides a new menu, option pages, toolbox windows, diagnostics, code actions, and debugging enhancements.

For details regarding the installation of this component, see <xref:installation> and <xref:installation-silent>. 


## NuGet packages

All build-time and run-time artifacts are released as NuGet packages. Build-time packages are required to build your projects, but only the content of run-time packages is required to execute your applications.

If you build NuGet packages that use PostSharp but does not define custom aspects, your package should only reference the relevant PostSharp run-time packages, not the build-time ones.

> [!NOTE]
> The PostSharp License Agreement refers to run-time packages as *redistributables*. The license agreement allows for royalty-free redistribution of run-time packages, but stricter conditions apply to the redistribution of build-time packages. 

The following table lists all PostSharp packages:

| Run-time package | Build-time package | Description |

| *PostSharp.Redist* | *PostSharp* | PostSharp Framework. The build-time package includes the PostSharp compiler. |

## Zip distribution

For teams that cannot use NuGet, PostSharp also comes as one zip archive containing the files otherwise contained in all NuGet packages.

In this archive, the *lib* folder contains run-time libraries (*redistributables*), and the *tools* folder contains all build-time components. 

See <xref:install-without-nuget> for details.
