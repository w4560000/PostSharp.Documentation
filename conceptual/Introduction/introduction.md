# Introduction

In conventional object-oriented programming, technical concerns like threading, INotifyPropertyChanged or logging generally result in a large amount of boilerplate code. This boilerplate code is tangled with business code, and makes it more difficult to understand and modify the business meaning of the source code.

Boilerplate code is in fact instances of source code patterns. As any pattern, their instances exhibit a great amount of regularity and predictability. Any decent software developer would be able to explain to their colleague how to properly implement INotifyPropertyChanged. These implementation guidelines would form some sort of algorithm, expressed in natural language, that the colleague would execute. Most of the work would be repetitive and would only require a limited amount of creativity.

Algorithmic work is exactly what machines are good at, so why not offload it the compiler? This is exactly what PostSharp has been designed for. Traditional languages have concepts like classes, methods, fields, but they don't have any construct to represent patterns like the implementation of INotifyPropertyChanged.

PostSharp adds support for patterns into the C# and VB languages, allowing developers to work more productively at a higher level of abstraction and to avoid the bugs that stem from working with a large amount of technical details.
