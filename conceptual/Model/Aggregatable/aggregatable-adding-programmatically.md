# Rule-Based Annotation

There are times where you cannot or don't want to add custom attributes manually.

For instance, you cannot add any custom attribute to an auto-generated field backing a XAML element. The WPF designer generates C# code from your XAML files and stores them in *i.g.cs* files hidden in the *obj* folder. You cannot modify these files directly. 

Another scenario is when you have a large amount of fields and don't want to annotate each of them individually.

Field rules allow you to annotate a field as a child or a reference programmatically, without adding a custom attribute to each field manually.

In the following example, let's consider a class where PostSharp shows an error message *
          COM002: “Field/property InvoiceLine.product must be
          annotated with a custom attribute [Child], [Reference] or [Parent].”
        * 

```csharp
[Aggregatable]
public class InvoiceLine
{
  private Product product;

  public decimal Amount { get; set; }
}
```


### To automatically mark all fields as references by default:

1. Create a class inherited from the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.TypeAdapters.FieldRule> class. 

    ```csharp
    public class RefererenceFieldRule : FieldRule
    ```


2. Override the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.TypeAdapters.FieldRule.GetRelationshipInfo(System.Reflection.FieldInfo)> method. PostSharp calls the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.TypeAdapters.FieldRule.GetRelationshipInfo(System.Reflection.FieldInfo)> method for each field that is not annotated with the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.ChildAttribute>, <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.ReferenceAttribute> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.ParentAttribute> custom attribute. The <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.TypeAdapters.FieldRule.GetRelationshipInfo(System.Reflection.FieldInfo)> method allows you to specify the field relationship by returning a <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.RelationshipInfo> instance. 

    ```csharp
    public override RelationshipInfo? GetRelationshipInfo(FieldInfo field)
    {
        return new RelationshipInfo(RelationshipKind.None, RelationshipKind.Reference);
    }
    ```


3. Decorate your project’s assembly with a <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Model.TypeAdapters.RegisterFieldRuleAttribute> custom attribute to activate your field rule. 

    ```csharp
    [assembly: RegisterFieldRule(typeof(RefererenceFieldRule))]
    ```

    > [!CAUTION]
    > You have to mark each project assembly to make your FieldRule active in the whole solution.


`product`> [!NOTE]
> PostSharp has two built-in rules: one rule for auto-generated WinForms fields and one rule for auto-generated XAML fields.
```xml
<Window x:Class="WpfApp.MainWindow"
        xmlns="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml/presentation"
        xmlns:x="http://schemas.microsoft.com/winfx/2006/xaml">
    <Grid>
        <Button x:Name="myButton" />
    </Grid>f
</Window>
```

In this example, the WPF designer generates a `myButton` field to a `MainWindow` class. Both the `myButton` field and the `MainWindow` class are indirectly inherited from [System.Windows.Controls.Control](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.controls.control.aspx). The built-in rule annotates the `myButton` field as a reference automatically.
