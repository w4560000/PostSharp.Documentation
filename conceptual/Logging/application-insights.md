# Logging with Application Insights

This article shows how to use PostSharp Logging and Application Insights together.


### To use PostSharp Logging with Application Insights:

1. Add PostSharp logging to your codebase as described in <xref:add-logging>. 


2. Add the *PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.ApplicationInsights* package to your startup project. 


3. Set up your Application Insights resource [according to the official guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview#get-started). 


4. In the application startup method, include the following code before any logged code:

    ```csharp
    // Configure PostSharp Logging to use Application Insights.
    LoggingServices.DefaultBackend = new ApplicationInsightsBackend("YOUR_INSTRUMENTATION_KEY");
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > You can also set the environment variable APPINSIGHTS_INSTRUMENTATIONKEY or use an *ApplicationInsights.config* file instead of passing the key to the constructor of <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Backends.ApplicationInsights.ApplicationInsightsLoggingBackend>.
