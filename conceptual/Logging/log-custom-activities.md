# Working with Custom Activities

More often than not, you will find yourself logging the beginning and the end of an activity, e.g. `Starting to read MyFile.xml` and `Succeeded to read MyFile.xml` or `Cannot read MyFile.xml: unexpected element at line 5`. An *activity* is anything that begins and eventually ends. 

You can open custom activities using the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.OpenActivity*>, <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.LogActivity*> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.LogActivityAsync*> method. 

Activities define a scope, so anything executing within that activity is properly indented. Therefore, activities are hierarchical: they have a notion of a child and of a parent and form a tree.

When you use the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogAttribute> aspect to log a method, it translates into an activity behind the scenes, which belongs to the same tree as custom activities. 


## Logging an activity, the explicit way


### To log a custom activity:

1. Add a <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogSource> to your class as descrived in <xref:log-custom-messages>. 


2. In a `using` statement, invoke the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.OpenActivity``1(``0@,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.OpenActivityOptions@)> method. Specify the activity description with the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.FormattedMessageBuilder.Formatted*> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.SemanticMessageBuilder.Semantic*> method. 

    > [!TIP]
    > We strongly advice to use the `var` keyword to receive the return value of <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.OpenActivity``1(``0@,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.OpenActivityOptions@)> method because the return type of the method depends on the number and types of arguments sent to <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.FormattedMessageBuilder.Formatted*> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.SemanticMessageBuilder.Semantic*>. Alternatively, you can use a variable of type <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.Messages.IMessage>, but this will cause boxing of the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1> value type. 


3. Wrap the code of the activity with a `try/catch` construct. 


4. In the `catch` block, call <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetException(System.Exception,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)>. 


5. In the `try`, call <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetSuccess(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetResult``1(``0,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)> or, if you need more flexibility, <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetOutcome``1(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogLevel,``0@,System.Exception,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)>. 


> [!CAUTION]
> All projects that use the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.OpenActivity``1(``0@,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.OpenActivityOptions@)> method in async methods MUST be processed by PostSharp, otherwise the execution of your application will fail. Therefore your projects must have a reference to the *PostSharp.Patterns.Common* package (a reference to *PostSharp.Patterns.Common.Redist* is not sufficient), and PostSharp must not be disabled on this project. Even if you don't have asynchronous code, it is recommended that you use the *PostSharp.Patterns.Common* package for performance reasons. 


### Example

The following code shows how to open and close an activity.

```cs
static class Hasher
    {
        static readonly LogSource logSource = Logger.GetLogger();

        private static byte[] ReadAndHash(string file)
        {
            using ( var activity = logSource.Default.OpenActivity( Formatted( "Processing file {Url}", file) ) )
            {
              try
              {
                  var totalSize = 0;
                
                  var hashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA256");
                  hashAlgorithm.Initialize();

                  var buffer = new byte[128 * 1024];

                  logSource.Info.Write( Formatted( "Working with a {BufferSize}-byte buffer.", buffer.Length ) );

                  using (var stream = File.OpenRead(file))
                  {
                      int countRead;
                      while ((countRead = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) != 0)
                      {
                          logSource.Info.Write( Formatted( "Got {CountRead} bytes.", countRead) );

                          hashAlgorithm.ComputeHash(buffer, 0, countRead);
                          totalSize += countRead;
                      }
                  }

                  activity.SetOutcome( LogLevel.Info, Formatted( "Success. Read {TotalSize} bytes in total.", totalSize) );
                
                  return hashAlgorithm.Hash;
              }
              catch ( Exception e )
              {
                  activity.SetException(e);
                  throw;
              }
           }

        }
    }
```


## Logging an activity the compact way, with an anonymous method

If you don't want to write the boilerplate code of the previous example over and over again, you can use the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.LogActivity*> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.LogActivityAsync*> method. These methods will execute a specified delegate within a new custom activity, and will automatically invoke the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetSuccess(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)>, <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetResult``1(``0,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)> or <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetException(System.Exception,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)> method as needed. 

The inconvenient consequence of using <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.Custom.LogLevelSource.LogActivity*> is that it will likely result in the allocation of an instance of a closure class on the heap, and affect performance even when logging is disabled. 


### Example

The following code does almost the same as the previous example but with fewer lines of code. The main difference is that, in the current example, the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetSuccess(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)> method is be invoked instead of <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogActivity`1.SetOutcome``1(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogLevel,``0@,System.Exception,PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.CloseActivityOptions@)>, and there is heap allocation even when logging is disabled. 

```cs
static class Hasher
    {
        static readonly LogSource logSource = Logger.GetLogger();

        private static byte[] ReadAndHash(string file)
        {
            var activity = logSource.Default.LogActivity( Formatted( "Processing file {Url}", file), 
               () => {
                var totalSize = 0;
                
                var hashAlgorithm = HashAlgorithm.Create("SHA256");
                hashAlgorithm.Initialize();

                var buffer = new byte[128 * 1024];

                logSource.Info.Write( Formatted( "Working with a {BufferSize}-byte buffer.", buffer.Length ) );

                using (var stream = File.OpenRead(file))
                {
                    int countRead;
                    while ((countRead = stream.Read(buffer, 0, buffer.Length)) != 0)
                    {
                        logSource.Info.Write( Formatted( "Got {CountRead} bytes.", countRead) );

                        hashAlgorithm.ComputeHash(buffer, 0, countRead);
                        totalSize += countRead;
                    }
                }

                return hashAlgorithm.Hash;
            } );
        }
    }
```


## Changing the default level for exceptions

When you open an activity with a specific level, say <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogSource.Debug>, and then close the activity successfully, the close message will be emitted with the same level as the open message, i.e. <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogSource.Debug>. 

However, when the activity fails with an exception, the close message level will be <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogSource.Failure>, whose value can be changed only by the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogSource.WithLevel(PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LogLevel)> method. See [Changing the default level for exceptions](log-custom-messages#to-configure-the-default-logging-levels-centrally) for information about changing the default levels. 


## Measuring the execution time of activities

You can measure the execution time of all activities by enabling the <xref:PostSharp.Patterns.Diagnostics.LoggingBackendOptions.IncludeActivityExecutionTime> property: 

```csharp
backend.Options.IncludeActivityExecutionTime = true;
```

This will cause the execution time to be appended to the close message.
