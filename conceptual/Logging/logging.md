# Logging

PostSharp Logging allows you to add logging to your complete solution in just a few lines of code.

It has the following benefits:

* Can produce super-detailed logs including parameter values and execution time.

* Can stay turned off by default and be dynamically enabled on-demand, with fine-grained control over types and namespaces, when a problem happens in production. This can be done just by editing a configuration file in an online file hosting service such as Google Drive.

* Super fast. In fact, often faster than `string.Format`. 

* Fully customizable. Works with your logging framework (even your custom one)

* Supports a broad set of logging frameworks.

* Supports structured log servers (such as Elastic Search or Application Insights) and statistical processing of messages.

* Supports distributed systems and helps generating correlation info.
