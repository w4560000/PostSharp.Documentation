# Developing Simple Aspects

Simple aspects are aspects that are composed of a single transformation. Developing a simple aspect in PostSharp is straightforward: you just have to create a new class, derive it from a primitive aspect class, and override some special methods named *advices*. 

If your aspect cannot be implemented as a single transformation, see <xref:complex-aspects>.
