# Overriding and Removing Aspect Instances

Having multiple instances of the same aspect on the same element of code is sometimes the desired behavior. With multicasting custom attributes (<xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttribute>), it is easy to end up with that situation. Indeed, many multicasting paths can lead to the same target. 

However, most of the time, a different behavior is preferred. We could define a method-level aspect on the type (this aspect would apply to all methods) and override (or even exclude) the aspect on a specific method.

The multicasting engine has both the ability to apply multiple aspect instances on the same target, and the ability to replace or remove custom attributes.


## Understanding the Multicasting Algorithm

Before going ahead, it is important to understand the multicasting algorithm. The algorithm relies on a notion of *order of processing* of aspect instances. 

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This section covers how PostSharp handles multiple instances of the **same aspect type** for the sole purpose of computing how aspect instances should be overridden or removed. See <xref:aspect-dependencies> to understand how to cope with multiple instances of different aspects. 

The following rules apply:

* Aspect instances defined on a container (for instance a type) have always precedence over instances defined on an item of that container (for instance a method). Elements of code are processed in the following order: assembly, module, type, field, property, event, method, parameter.

* When multiple aspect instances are defined on the same level, they are sorted by increasing value of the <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttribute.AttributePriority>. 

The algorithm builds a list of aspect instances applied (directly and indirectly) on an element of code, sorts these instances, and processes overrides or removals as described below.


## Applying Multiple Instances of the Same Aspect

The property <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttributeUsageAttribute.AllowMultiple> determines whether multiple instances of the same aspect are allowed on an element of code. By default, this property is set to `true` for all aspects. 

In the following example, the methods in type `MyClass` are enhanced by one, two and three instances of the `Trace` aspect (see code comments). 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using PostSharp.Aspects;
using PostSharp.Extensibility;
using PostSharp.Serialization;
using Samples3;

[assembly: Trace(AttributeTargetTypes = "Samples3.My*", Category = "A")]
[assembly: Trace(AttributeTargetTypes = "Samples3.My*",
    AttributeTargetMemberAttributes = MulticastAttributes.Public, Category = "B")]

namespace Samples3
{
    [PSerializable]
    public sealed class TraceAttribute : OnMethodBoundaryAspect
    {
        public string Category { get; set; }

        public override void OnEntry(MethodExecutionArgs args)
        {
            Trace.WriteLine("Entering " +
                            args.Method.DeclaringType.FullName + "." + args.Method.Name, this.Category);
        }
    }


    public class MyClass
    {
        // This method will have 1 Trace aspect with Category set to A.
        private void Method1()
        {
        }

        // This method will have 2 Trace aspects with Category set to A, B
        public void Method2()
        {
        }

        // This method will have 3 Trace aspects with Category set to A, B, C.
        [Trace(Category = "C")]
        public void Method3()
        {
        }
    }
}
```


## Overriding an Aspect Instance Manually

You can require an aspect instance to override any previous one by setting the aspect property <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttribute.AttributeReplace>. This is equivalent to a deletion followed by an insertion (see below). 

In the following examples, the first two methods of type `MyClass` are enhanced by aspects applied at assembly level, but these aspects are replaced by a different one on `Method3`. 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using PostSharp.Aspects;
using PostSharp.Extensibility;
using PostSharp.Serialization;
using Samples5;

[assembly: Trace(AttributeTargetTypes = "Samples5.My*", Category = "A")]
[assembly: Trace(AttributeTargetTypes = "Samples5.My*",
    AttributeTargetMemberAttributes = MulticastAttributes.Public, Category = "B")]

namespace Samples5
{
    [PSerializable]
    public sealed class TraceAttribute : OnMethodBoundaryAspect
    {
        public string Category { get; set; }

        public override void OnEntry(MethodExecutionArgs args)
        {
            Trace.WriteLine("Entering " +
                            args.Method.DeclaringType.FullName + "." + args.Method.Name, this.Category);
        }
    }


    public class MyClass
    {
        // This method will have 1 Trace aspect with Category set to A.
        private void Method1()
        {
        }

        // This method will have 2 Trace aspect with Category set to A, B.
        public void Method2()
        {
        }

        // This method will have 1 Trace aspects with Category set to C.
        [Trace(Category = "C", AttributeReplace = true)]
        public void Method3()
        {
        }
    }
}
```


## Overriding an Aspect Instance Automatically

To cause a new aspect instance to automatically override any previous one, the aspect developer must disallow multiple instances by annotating the aspect class with the custom attribute <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttributeUsageAttribute> and setting the property <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttributeUsageAttribute.AllowMultiple> to `false`. 

In the following example, the methods in type `MyClass` are enhanced by a single `Trace` aspect: 

```csharp
using System;
using System.Diagnostics;
using PostSharp.Aspects;
using PostSharp.Extensibility;
using PostSharp.Serialization;
using Samples4;

[assembly: Trace(AttributeTargetTypes = "Samples4.My*", AttributePriority = 1, Category = "A")]
[assembly: Trace(AttributeTargetTypes = "Samples4.My*",
    AttributeTargetMemberAttributes = MulticastAttributes.Public, AttributePriority = 2, Category = "B")]

namespace Samples4
{
    [MulticastAttributeUsage(MulticastTargets.Method, AllowMultiple = false)]
    [PSerializable]
    public sealed class TraceAttribute : OnMethodBoundaryAspect
    {
        public string Category { get; set; }

        public override void OnEntry(MethodExecutionArgs args)
        {
            Trace.WriteLine("Entering " +
                            args.Method.DeclaringType.FullName + "." + args.Method.Name, this.Category);
        }
    }


    public class MyClass
    {
        // This method will have 1 Trace aspect with Category set to A.
        private void Method1()
        {
        }

        // This method will have 1 Trace aspects with Category set to B.
        public void Method2()
        {
        }

        // This method will have 1 Trace aspects with Category set to C.
        [Trace(Category = "C")]
        public void Method3()
        {
        }
    }
}
```


## Deleting an Aspect Instance

The <xref:PostSharp.Extensibility.MulticastAttribute.AttributeExclude> `` property removes any previous instance of the same aspect on a target. 

This is useful, for instance, when you need to exclude a target from the matching set of a wildcard expression. For instance:

```csharp
[assembly: Configurable( AttributeTypes = "BusinessLayer.*" )]

          namespace BusinessLayer
          {
            [Configurable( AttributeExclude = true )]
            public static class Helpers
            {

            }
          }
```
